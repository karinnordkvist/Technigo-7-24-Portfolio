# Technigo-7-24-Portfolio

This week's assignment was to create my portfolio based on fixed design guidelines, to validate and check my code and to make the site fully accessible.

## The problem

I really enjoyed working with HTML and CSS again this week. It was a nice little breather from all Javascript. After working a bit on the structure and basic CSS I realized that the design would be much easier to accomplish using Sass (which I have learned a bit during a previous short course). So I decided to read up on how to get started on Sass, and REALLY liked how easy all the styling got when you could cluster, create variables and mixins. It was a bliss not having to repeat myself.

With all design in place I got to work on accessibility, adding aria-components, sr-only and tabindex. I worked a lot with the Lighthouse-plugin in the developer tools, trying to max out all the meters. In the end I had to do a few sections over, editing structure and clarifying some h-levels to get all tests approved. I also worked on performance and SEO, adding og-tags and changing all images to approporiate formats/sizes. That way I also had to add the images to a picture-tag with srcset to make them appear in all browsers.

I decided to use my own existing domain for this and added the files to a subdomain named 'developer'. In the future I intend on moving my design portfolio (current root) to a subdomain and set the developer-site as root.

I look forward to updating this portfolio as the bootcamp proceeds.
